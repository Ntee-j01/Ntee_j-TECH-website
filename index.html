---

Hey there! I'm Ngoni, a 16-year-old tech enthusiast with a passion for coding and hacking. Welcome to my website, where I share my adventures in the world of programming and web development.

With a strong foundation in Python and JavaScript, I'm always looking to expand my skills and take on new challenges. Currently, I'm diving deeper into web development, exploring the latest technologies and techniques to build fast, secure, and user-friendly websites.

As a hacker at heart, I love solving problems and finding creative solutions. I'm constantly learning and experimenting, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with code.

On this website, I'll be sharing my projects, tutorials, and insights into the world of programming and web development. Whether you're a fellow coder or just starting out, I hope you'll find something useful and inspiring here.</em></p>
